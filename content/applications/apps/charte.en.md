#### 1. Introduction
All applications published by **Cyril Portet Dev** follow the exact same privacy policy.  
These applications are developed by an independent developer.

This privacy policy explains what data these applications collect (or do not collect), how it is used, and your rights as a user.

#### 2. Data collected
**Applications developed by Cyril Portet do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Here is exactly what these applications may do:

- They may read the list of installed applications on your Windows device using official public Windows APIs (Windows.ApplicationModel.Package).
- They may locally save your organization preferences (favorites, groups, order, colors, etc.) in a configuration file stored exclusively in the app’s local folder (AppData).
- They contain no telemetry system, no trackers, and no third-party analytics services (no Microsoft Clarity, Google Analytics, etc.).
- They do not access your personal files, photos, contacts, location, or any other sensitive data.
- They do not require and do not use any internet connection.

#### 3. Permissions requested
No special permissions are required.  
The applications work completely offline and within the Windows sandbox.

#### 4. Sharing or transmission of data
No data is shared or transmitted.  
Your data remains exclusively on your device.

#### 5. Data security
All configuration data is stored locally on your PC in the protected directory of the applications.  
When an application is fully uninstalled via Windows Settings or the Microsoft Store, this data is automatically deleted.

#### 6. GDPR & Microsoft Store compliance
- The applications fully comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- They are declared to the Microsoft Store in the “No data collected” category.
- No data is transferred to third countries.

#### 7. Changes to the privacy policy
