The "My Apps" application was a prototype built with WinUI, designed to create a universal application launcher.

It allowed users to gather and organize all the applications installed on their Windows device within a single, customizable interface.
This application is no longer actively maintained at the moment, but I plan to resume work on the code soon, publish it on GitHub, and update the app on the Microsoft Store.
