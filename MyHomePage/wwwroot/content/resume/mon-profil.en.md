I am open to new opportunities and collaborations.

Equally comfortable in **Agile** environments as in Waterfall approaches, I let user satisfaction and software quality be my only guiding compasses.

My expertise particularly focuses on Agile project management (Kanban, Scrum) and Management.<br />
Technically, I particularly master the development of web applications or solutions, especially with **ASP.NET** (**MVC** or **Blazor WebAssembly**).

I also have solid experience in project and team management, software architecture, and a good understanding of business challenges and work processes.

I have lived and worked in Picardy, in Île-de-France, and in Belgium, and I am now settled in the Lyon region where I work for a software publisher.

I have worked in various sectors, notably industry, services, public administration, and software publishing.
